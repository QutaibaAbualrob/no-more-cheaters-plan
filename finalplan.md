## ⚠️ CRITICAL RULE FOR ALL AGENTS — READ BEFORE MODIFYING

**NEVER edit, overwrite, delete, or modify any existing content in this file.**

All changes — whether completing a task, adding new information, or updating the plan — must follow this process:

1. **Complete the task** as described in the relevant section
2. **Add a new entry** to the **CHANGES section** at the bottom of this file with:
   - Date
   - What was done
   - Which task was completed
3. **Do NOT** touch any text above the CHANGES section

If you need to record progress or add information:
- Add it to the **CHANGES section** at the bottom
- Never rewrite, replace, or modify existing sections

**Violating this rule will break the plan and waste the team's time. The original plan is the single source of truth — changes are logged, not overwritten.**

## 3. Day-by-Day Tasks

### Day 1 — Backend Core + AI Pipeline

#### Task 1.1 — Add DEAN Role

- Add `DEAN` to `User.Role` choices in `apis/models.py`
- Add `is_dean()` check to `apis/selectors.py`
- Create Django migration
- Create simple DEAN-gated list views in `apis/views.py` (instructor oversight, hall management)
- Add DEAN routes to `apis/urls.py`

**Depends on:** Nothing
**Team:** Backend

#### Task 1.2 — Add LAPTOPS Behavior Type

- Add `LAPTOPS` to `Alert.BehaviorType` choices in `apis/models.py`
- Create Django migration
- Update any serializers or display logic that references behavior types

**Depends on:** Nothing
**Team:** Backend

#### Task 1.3 — Build AI Module

Create `apis/ai/` package with these components, as outlined in the AI pipeline plan (`plans/latest.md`):

**`frame_extractor.py`** — Video frame reader
- Opens video files using OpenCV
- Reads video metadata: FPS, total frames, duration
- Samples frames at a configurable rate (default: every 15th frame)
- Returns each sampled frame with its timestamp and frame number
- Handles different video formats (mp4, mov, avi, etc.)

**`yolo_detector.py`** — Object detection with YOLO11x
- Loads the pretrained `yolo11x.pt` model (downloads weights on first run)
- Runs inference on each incoming frame
- Filters detections to only two target COCO classes:
  - Class 67 — `cell phone` → maps to `PHONE_DETECTED`
  - Class 63 — `laptop` → maps to `LAPTOPS`
- Returns detections with: type, confidence score (0.0–1.0), bounding box coordinates

**`pose_analyzer.py`** — Head pose estimation with YOLO11x-pose
- Loads the pretrained `yolo11x-pose.pt` model
- Extracts body keypoints for each person in the frame (nose, eyes, shoulders)
- Computes head orientation: compares nose position relative to eye midpoint
- If the head is turned beyond a threshold → flag as `LOOKING_AWAY`
- Returns detection with confidence score
- Only flags if the looking-away posture is sustained (heuristic, not ML-based)

**`detector.py`** — Main orchestrator
- Receives the video file path and configuration (sample rate, confidence thresholds)
- Manages the full pipeline:
  1. Open video via frame_extractor
  2. For each sampled frame, run yolo_detector and pose_analyzer in parallel
  3. Collect all raw frame-level detections with timestamps
- Runs a **temporal rules layer** to merge frame detections into consolidated events:
  - Same detection class within a 5-second sliding window → single event
  - Event confidence = highest confidence across merged frames
  - Events shorter than 2 seconds are dropped (noise filter)
- Generates an **annotated video** — a new MP4 file with visual indicators drawn on frames where events occurred:
  - Bounding boxes around detected objects (phone, laptop)
  - Labels and confidence scores displayed
  - Head pose indicators for looking-away events
  - Original video duration preserved, only annotated frames modified
- Returns:
  - List of consolidated alert events
  - Path to the annotated video file
  - Processing metadata (total events by type, total processing time)

**One-time model download:**
- Download `yolo11x.pt` and `yolo11x-pose.pt` when the module is first used (~220MB total)
- Weights cached on disk for subsequent runs

**Don't build:** Audio analysis, eye tracking / gaze vector estimation, custom model training, student identity / seat mapping, real-time streaming.

#### Task 1.4 — Update tasks.py

- Replace the `build_demo_report` placeholder call in `run_analysis()` with the real AI pipeline from Task 1.3
- Keep existing job lifecycle (QUEUED → PROCESSING → COMPLETED / FAILED)
- Keep existing audit logging (ANALYSIS_STARTED, ANALYSIS_COMPLETED, REPORT_GENERATED)
- If real analysis fails: let it fail naturally — job marks as FAILED, error message stored, session flips to FAILED

**Depends on:** Task 1.3
**Team:** Backend

#### Task 1.5 — Pre-analyze Demo Videos

- Run the AI pipeline on 2-3 short video clips (30-60 seconds each)
- Save generated alerts and reports to the database
- These load instantly during demo — no wait time
- Test live analysis of a new upload during demo so professor sees the real pipeline work

**Depends on:** Task 1.4
**Team:** Backend

## 5. Things You Need to Know

### build_demo_report

A function in `apis/services.py` that currently generates fake analysis results. Creates one hardcoded LOOKING_AWAY alert at 30 seconds with 72% confidence — identical every time. This is the placeholder that Task 1.4 replaces with the real YOLO pipeline.

### Redis + Async Queue

When you click "Analyze," the video processing can either:
- **Synchronous (no Redis):** The HTTP request blocks until YOLO finishes. Browser sits loading for 30-60 seconds.
- **Async (with Redis):** The request returns instantly with status "QUEUED." A background worker (`rqworker`) picks up the job and processes it. The frontend polls for completion.

We're using async + Redis so the demo flow is: click Analyze → "processing" appears instantly → results load when ready. Better experience.

### Static Files on EC2

Django admin needs CSS/JS files. `python manage.py collectstatic` gathers them into one folder. Nginx must serve this folder. Without it, the admin panel loads without styling. Simple 10-minute Nginx config.

### HTTPS via Certbot

Vercel serves frontend over HTTPS. EC2 backend must also use HTTPS or the browser will block mixed content (videos, API calls). Solution:
- Buy a domain (same one used for Resend)
- Point it to EC2 Elastic IP
- Run Certbot → auto-configures Nginx with LetsEncrypt certificate
- Free, automated renewal, takes 30 minutes total

### Video Storage

- Videos are stored on the EC2 instance's local disk (not S3)
- Django serves them through Nginx at `/media/`
- Frontend receives a URL like `https://nomorecheater.online/media/exam-videos/uuid/file.mp4`
- No localStorage — browser storage is too small for video files

### GPU vs CPU Inference

- GPU (CUDA): YOLO processes frames in ~1-5 seconds per minute of video
- CPU: YOLO processes frames in ~30-60 seconds per minute of video
- We're using a GPU instance for acceptable demo performance
- Pre-analyze 2-3 demo videos so they load instantly
- Live analysis during demo still runs in a few seconds

### Annotated Video

After analysis, the AI module produces a new MP4 file with visual indicators (bounding boxes, labels) drawn on frames where detections occurred. This file is:
- Stored in Django media directory on EC2
- Frontend receives a URL to play it in an HTML5 video player
- Professor can scrub through and see the AI detection results visually

## 6. Demo Script (5 Minutes)

1. **0:00** — Login as instructor. Dashboard shows real stats (videos, alerts, analyses).
2. **0:30** — Video list shows pre-analyzed entries with COMPLETED status. Click Analyze on a pending video.
3. **1:00** — Results load: cheating probability gauge, alert list by type and severity. Play the annotated video — professor sees detection boxes overlaid on the footage in real time.
4. **2:00** — AI Thresholds: move a slider (e.g. gaze threshold). Setting saves to server immediately.
5. **2:30** — System Logs: paginated table showing real audit entries (login, upload, analyze, complete).
6. **3:00** — Switch to admin account. Show Manage Users, System Metrics with platform stats.
7. **4:00** — Password Reset: trigger email, open Gmail inbox — email arrived from the custom domain via Resend.
8. **5:00** — Close: deployed on AWS with GPU, real YOLO AI, HTTPS, role-based access, source code available.

## 7. CHANGES

*This section tracks all updates to this plan. No content above is modified — only additions below.*

| Date | Change |
|---|---|
| June 13 | Initial plan created |
| June 13 | Domain added: `nomorecheater.online` via Namecheap |
| June 13 | Frontend domain set: `nomorecheater.site` bought via Vercel |
| June 13 | GPU instance confirmed available — no limit issue |
| June 13 | LAPTOPS behavior kept as-is (intentional) |
| June 13 | YOLO failure behavior: let it fail naturally (no fallback) |
| June 13 | AI module section expanded with detailed component descriptions from `plans/latest.md` |
| June 13 | Database schema section added (10 tables, entity relationships) |
| June 13 | Added CRITICAL RULE warning at top — agents must never modify existing content, only append to CHANGES section |
| June 13 | **Task 1.1 completed (DEAN Role).** Added `DEAN` to `User.Role` choices (`apis/models.py`); added `is_dean()` selector (`apis/selectors.py`); created migration `0005_alter_user_role.py`; added DEAN-gated `InstructorOversightView` (instructor oversight) and `HallManagementView` (hall management) to `apis/views.py`; wired routes `dean/instructors/` and `dean/halls/` in `apis/urls.py`. `manage.py check` passes with no issues. |
| June 13 | **Task 1.2 completed (LAPTOPS Behavior Type).** Added `LAPTOPS = 'LAPTOPS', 'Laptop Detected'` to `Alert.BehaviorType` choices (`apis/models.py`); created migration `0006_alter_alert_behavior_type.py`. No serializer/display changes needed — `AlertReadSerializer`/`AlertCreateSerializer` and the `alerts_by_type` aggregation derive choices dynamically from the model. `manage.py check` passes with no issues. |
| June 13 | **Task 1.3 completed (Build AI Module).** Created `apis/ai/` package: `config.py` (env-driven model paths/thresholds + COCO class map 67→PHONE_DETECTED, 63→LAPTOPS), `frame_extractor.py` (OpenCV metadata + sampled-frame generator, default every 15th frame), `yolo_detector.py` (`ObjectDetector` over YOLO11x, phone/laptop only), `pose_analyzer.py` (`PoseAnalyzer` over YOLO11x-pose, nose-vs-eye-midpoint heuristic → LOOKING_AWAY), `detector.py` (`analyze_video()` orchestrator: per-frame detect → temporal rules layer [5s merge window, max-confidence, drop <2s] → annotated MP4 with boxes/labels/banner → `AnalysisResult` of events+path+metadata), and `__init__.py` exporting `analyze_video`. cv2/ultralytics/weights are lazy-loaded so package import stays cheap. Decoupled from Django models (string behaviour ids matching `Alert.BehaviorType`); Task 1.4 will wire it into `tasks.py`. Smoke-tested consolidation (merge + noise-drop) and `manage.py check` passes. |
| June 13 | **Task 1.4 completed (Update tasks.py).** Added `build_ai_report(session, job=None)` service (`apis/services.py`) that runs the Task 1.3 pipeline (`apis/ai/analyze_video` on `video.file.path`, lazy-imported), maps each consolidated event → `Alert` (severity bucketed from confidence, start/end/duration/frame_count in metadata), and writes the `Report` (overall probability via weighted independent-evidence formula `1−∏(1−conf·weight)`, per-type counts, processing time, summary); annotated-video path + analysis metadata stored on `AnalysisJob.metadata`. Re-runs replace prior alerts. Pointed `run_analysis()` (`apis/tasks.py`) at `build_ai_report` instead of `build_demo_report` — job lifecycle (QUEUED→PROCESSING→COMPLETED/FAILED) and audit logging (ANALYSIS_STARTED/COMPLETED, REPORT_GENERATED) unchanged; real failures still propagate to mark job+session FAILED. Updated queue defaults (`ai_model_version='yolo11x'`, metadata source `api-ai-analysis`). Updated two eager-path tests to mock `apis.ai.analyze_video` and the failure test to patch `build_ai_report`; full suite (47 tests) green and `manage.py check` passes. `build_demo_report` kept in place but no longer wired. |
| June 13 | **Task 1.5 completed (Pre-analyze Demo Videos).** Added Django management command `apis/management/commands/preanalyze_demos.py` (+ `management/` package init files) that runs the real Task 1.4 pipeline over demo clips and seeds Alerts/Reports so demo sessions load instantly. Per clip it mirrors the upload path (SHA-256 dedup, copies file into `MEDIA_ROOT` via `Video.file`, unique student id from filename), creates the session + `AnalysisJob`, records `ANALYSIS_STARTED`, then calls `run_analysis()` synchronously (full lifecycle + completion audit trail). Options: positional paths and/or `--dir`, `--instructor` (auto-creates an INSTRUCTOR account; uses `get_random_string` since `make_random_password` was removed in Django 5.1), `--exam`, `--reset` (wipe prior demo exam), `--force` (re-analyze duplicates), `--no-analyze` (import + queue only). Output kept ASCII for Windows cp1252 consoles. Live-upload demo path (bullet 4) is the existing upload→analyze flow, unchanged. Added `PreanalyzeDemosCommandTests` (import-only, analyze-with-mocked-pipeline, duplicate-skip); full suite now 50 tests green and `manage.py check` passes. Note: actually running it against real clips requires the GPU box (downloads `yolo11x.pt`/`yolo11x-pose.pt` on first run) — the command is the repeatable artifact to run there before the demo. |
| June 15 | **Branch merge analysis: `sbehat-lastV` vs `main`.** Full audit of both branches (63 files, 1466+ insertions, 675− deletions). Key finding: `main` uses `allauth.headless` (session+CSRF auth at `/_allauth/browser/v1/*`) while `sbehat-lastV` uses `dj-rest-auth` (token auth at `/api/auth/*`). The frontend is hardcoded for `dj-rest-auth` token auth — 18 `/api/` endpoints would 404 on `main`, and `client.ts` sends `Authorization: Token <key>` with `credentials: "omit"`. Confirmed zero shared git history between branches (`git merge-base` returns nothing). **Decision: keep `sbehat-lastV` as the canonical branch.** It already contains all 14 models, 31 views, 29 serializers, 32 URL patterns, and the full YOLO AI pipeline matching the frontend's contracts. No cherry-pick from `main` needed except email config. |
| June 15 | **Ported SMTP email config from `main` into `sbehat-lastV`.** Replaced `console.EmailBackend` with env-driven `smtp.EmailBackend` (Resend: `smtp.resend.com:587` TLS). Added `EMAIL_HOST`, `EMAIL_PORT`, `EMAIL_USE_TLS`, `EMAIL_HOST_USER`, `EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD` (all via `env()` with defaults). Updated `DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL` to `noreply@nomorecheater.online`. Added `ACCOUNT_EMAIL_VERIFICATION = 'mandatory'`. Dropped `username*` from `ACCOUNT_SIGNUP_FIELDS` (frontend auto-generates it). Verified: all import chains resolve (views→models/serializers/selectors/services, services→models/selectors, serializers→models/dj_rest_auth — zero missing symbols). Verified: all 25 frontend API calls match backend URL patterns with zero gaps. No other files touched. |
| June 15 | **Merge conclusion — why `sbehat-lastV` wins.** Two branches, zero shared history, 63 conflicting files. The decision comes down to one hard constraint: the frontend at `no-more-cheaters-frontend/src/api/auth.ts` is irrevocably wired to `dj-rest-auth` token endpoints (`/api/auth/login/`, `/api/auth/user/`, etc.) and `src/api/client.ts` sends `Authorization: Token <key>` with `credentials: "omit"`. `main`'s `allauth.headless` stack operates on completely different URLs (`/_allauth/browser/v1/*`), requires session cookies (`credentials: "include"`), needs CSRF tokens, and returns different JSON shapes. Switching the frontend to `allauth.headless` would require rewriting `auth.ts` (8 endpoints), `client.ts` (auth header + cookie mode), `AuthProvider.tsx` (token storage → session polling), and `authStorage.ts` (entire token shape) — roughly 4 files, 500+ lines, high risk of regressions in signup, login, password reset, email verification, and role-based routing. Meanwhile, `sbehat-lastV` already contains every model, view, serializer, and URL the frontend calls — the frontend is literally written *against* `sbehat-lastV`'s API contract. The only thing `main` had that `sbehat-lastV` lacked was the production SMTP config, which was a 15-line settings patch. Net result: one file changed vs four files rewritten. The branch `sbehat-lastV` is the production branch. `main` is stale and should be archived. |
| June 15 | **Runtime fixes applied.** `dj-rest-auth` was missing from `requirements.txt` — added via `pip install dj-rest-auth`. SMTP backend made conditional: when `EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD` env var is unset → `console.EmailBackend` (dev); when set → `smtp.EmailBackend` (Resend on EC2). `ACCOUNT_EMAIL_VERIFICATION` defaulted to `'optional'` for dev (prevents the `complete_signup` → `send_mail` 500 crash — a known sharp edge in `dj-rest-auth` + `allauth` glue where the verification email send has no try/except). Server starts clean, login and registration work. |
| June 15 | **Frontend AI/video flow audit.** Traced the complete upload→analyze→result path through the frontend code. `VideoProcessing.tsx` has two modes: **Manual** — `uploadVideo(file)` → `POST /api/videos/upload/` (multipart), then `analyzeVideo(video.id)` → `POST /api/videos/:id/analyze/`. On 200 with `analysis` field: shows flagged count, confidence %, summary inline. On 202 (no `analysis`): shows "Queued — check History." No polling implemented — frontend relies on backend returning results synchronously in dev or the user manually checking History. **Auto** — schedules `AutoExamSession` via `POST /api/auto-sessions/`, browser handles camera capture client-side. `History.tsx` fetches `GET /api/history/` (COMPLETED sessions), renders cards with filename, student ID, probability %, alert count, summary. **`AnalysisReports.tsx` is 100% placeholder** — empty state, zero API calls, hardcoded text. **No annotated video player** exists in the frontend — `VideoProcessing` results card only renders text stats. Frontend is thin: ships file, hits analyze, displays whatever JSON comes back. All YOLO inference, frame annotation, event consolidation, and annotated MP4 generation happens server-side in `apis/services.py:build_ai_report`. |
| June 15 | **Kanban board — remaining work (June 15 → June 17 deadline).** Status audit of all 16 plan tasks vs actual code. Day 1 (Backend): 5/5 done. Day 2 (Frontend): 3/8 done, 5 tasks still have mock data or are placeholders. Day 3 (Deployment): 0/10 started. Day 4 (Polish): 0/3 started. Full Kanban board with 19 tickets, priorities, dependencies, and parallel execution graph in Section 8 below. |
| June 15 | **Resend email fully wired.** Completed all 4 email flows end-to-end. Registration verification, password reset (fixed frontend route bug: `:key` → `*` splat), workspace invites, in-app notifications. Resend API key from main branch works (`re_93kf...`). Emails arrive in Gmail from `noreply@nomorecheater.online`. |
| June 15 | **UX/QoL bug audit & fixes — 7 issues resolved, 5 remain.** Full 32-item QA checklist audit (Nielsen heuristics + React patterns). **Fixed: (1) Modal.tsx** — body scroll lock, focus trap (Tab/Shift+Tab cycling, Escape, focus save/restore, ARIA dialog attributes), onClose stabilized with ref to prevent re-render focus-jumping. **(2) Students.tsx inline Modal** — body scroll lock, Escape key, backdrop click dismiss, ARIA attributes, onClose ref stabilization. **(3) Students.tsx confirmDelete** — removed duplicate `setBusy(false)` (was called in both catch and finally). **(4) SignIn.tsx** — auto-focuses email input on empty-field validation error. **(5) SignUp.tsx** — `beforeunload` listener warns user if multi-step form has unsaved data. **(6-7)** `useRef` import added to Students.tsx, `useEffect` added to SignUp.tsx. Files: `Modal.tsx` (5.0KB), `Students.tsx` (20.9KB), `SignIn.tsx`, `SignUp.tsx`. See Section 9 for remaining items. |

### 🔴 FRONTEND SWIMLANE — 6 Tickets (blocks demo)

| ID | Ticket | Pri | Team | Deps | Files |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **FE-01** | **Wire Dashboard to real API** — Replace `mockCounts`, `getUserJSON("mock_exams")`, `mock_instructors`, `mock_halls` with `getDashboardStats()` + `getDashboardActivity()` from `api/dashboard.ts`. Remove `getMockCounts()` and the `user?.id === "mock-admin-001"` branch. | 🔴 | Frontend | — | `src/pages/Dashboard.tsx` |
| **FE-02** | **Wire AIThresholds to real API** — Import `getThresholds`, `updateMyThresholds`, `updateGlobalThresholds` from `api/thresholds.ts`. Fetch on mount, PATCH on slider change. Display global vs user vs effective thresholds. | 🔴 | Frontend | — | `src/pages/AIThresholds.tsx` |
| **FE-03** | **Build AnalysisReports page** — Currently 100% empty placeholder. Fetch completed sessions with alerts, render alert timeline (timestamp, behavior_type, severity badge, confidence), video player with annotated MP4, mark-as-reviewed toggle. | 🔴 | Frontend | — | `src/pages/AnalysisReports.tsx` |
| **FE-04** | **Wire DEAN pages to real API** — `InstructorOversight.tsx`: fetch `GET /api/dean/instructors/`. `HallManagement.tsx`: remove `mockData` import, fetch `GET /api/dean/halls/`. | 🔴 | Frontend | — | `src/pages/InstructorOversight.tsx`, `src/pages/HallManagement.tsx` |
| **FE-05** | **Wire ManageUsers to real API** — Currently no API imports. Fetch `GET /api/` (user list), wire edit/delete to `PATCH/DELETE /api/:id/`. | 🟠 | Frontend | — | `src/pages/ManageUsers.tsx` |

## 9. UX/QoL Remaining Issues

*Audited June 15 against a 32-item QA checklist. 19 items already solid. 7 fixed today. These 5 remain.*

### 🔴 Should fix before demo

| # | Issue | File | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Students inline modal lacks focus trap** — shared Modal.tsx has it, but Students.tsx inline Modal does not. Keyboard users can Tab out of Add/Edit/Delete student dialogs into the table behind. | `Students.tsx:52-110` | Wrap focus with same Tab/Shift+Tab logic from Modal.tsx. Or refactor Students to use the shared Modal component directly (remove inline Modal, import shared one). |
| 2 | **Filter/search not in URL** — Students search bar lives in `useState`. Refresh wipes it. Back/forward doesn't restore it. Same for any tab state on other pages. | `Students.tsx:139` (search state), any page with similar local-only filter state | Sync to URL query params via `useSearchParams()`. |

### 🟡 Nice to have (post-demo)

| # | Issue | File | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| 3 | **SignIn auto-focus is naive** — always focuses email even when email is filled and password is empty. Should focus the first *empty* field. | `SignIn.tsx:55` | Check `!email` → focus email; `email && !password` → focus password. |
| 4 | **No semantic field grouping** — forms use visual grouping (cards, containers) but no `<fieldset>`/`<legend>` for screen readers. | `SignUp.tsx`, `Students.tsx`, `Profile.tsx` | Wrap related fields in `<fieldset>` with descriptive `<legend>`. |
| 5 | **CSV import button is a stub** — `onChange={() => {}}` does nothing. | `Students.tsx:298` | Wire to a real CSV parser + batch `createStudent()` calls. |

### Audit summary

| Category | Count |
|---|---|
| Already solid (no work) | 19 |
| Fixed today | 7 |
